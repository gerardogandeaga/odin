Developed in SFU's Intro to Software Engineering (CMPT276 Fall 2020), Odin is our mobile app solution to better exam proctoring and student verification for Professors. 
The app leverages Google's Firbase Services to provide a realtime user experience. The purpose of the app is 2-fold, for students to register 
for upcoming examinations and easily upload their ID for verification; And for profressors to manage exam attendance, verify student IDs and ensure 
phone usage is limited while the exam is underway.

This application was written in Java with some NodeJS backend components in firebase cloud functions and a Android-only app.
